# Atomos

> This particle cannon generates a condensed beam of super-heated plasma designed to melt rock to ore, and enemies to molten slag.

This simple tool recursively removes module directories (`node_modules` & `bower_components`).

Its particularity lies in its ability to delete only module directories in the same location as the manifest files are stored (`package.json` & `bower.json`).

## Install

```
$ npm install --global atomos
```

## Usage

```
$ atomos [path]
```
